	\caption{The entry $A_{21}$, $A_{31}$, and $A_{32}$ of matrix $A$ are the three entries
		that we would like clean up
		so that we may obtain a right upper triangular matrix.
		Givens-Rotation matrix for $A_{21}$, $A_{31}$, and $A_{32}$ is $G_{21}$, $G_{31}$, and $G_{32}$, respectively.
		The order of applying $G_{21}$ first or $G_{31}$ or $G_{32}$ is no matter, but
		the coefficients used to build the Givens-Rotation matrix $r$, $a$, and $b$
		have to be carefully computed, since they become various
		after every time applying the rotation.}
